            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a
            programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that
            programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents
            the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to
            the page.‚Äù

            A Web page is a document. This document
            can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same
            document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same
            document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of
            the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
